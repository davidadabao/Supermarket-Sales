# Supermarket-Sales
This project aims to drive strategic decision-making, optimize performance, and maximize revenue growth through actionable insights and data-driven solutions. The dataset contains 1, 000 sales of client orders for different item categories in the cities Mandalay, Naypyidaw, and Yangon, which are located in Myanmar (Burma). Myanmar (Burma) is a country situated in Asia.

The project features the following information below that can help us make decisions that will help make future decisions that will help grow the business:
1.	Period  (Timeline)
2.	City
3.	Gender
4.	Payment method
5.	Customer type
6.	Products line with highest sale
7.	Top 5 customers

The combination of these data fields helped us arrive at the following questions, findings, and conclusions.
